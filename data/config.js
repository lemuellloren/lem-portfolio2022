    I have proceeded my dream to be a developer as it has been my passion. 
    I am a talented Front-End developer with a UI/UX design background.
    I had the opportunity to enhance my expertise by collaborating with different companies 
    and by creating useful content for both business and customer use.
    I am naturally persevered, self-confident, quietly curios, innovative and constantly challenging my skills.
