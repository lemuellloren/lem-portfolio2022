### Install the dependencies

Ba-da-boom! Your code is all there.... however you need to install dependencies like React, NextJS, and TailwindCSS into your project so the stuff actually works! Do so by installing them with the package manager of your choice:

```bash
# NPM
npm i

# Yarn
yarn
```

### Edit content

Now, before you run it locally, you should edit the content first!

To do so, open the `data/config.js` file and edit the values to what makes you, you!

### Run locally!

To see it in action in your browser, run the `dev` script:

```bash
# NPM
npm run dev

# Yarn
yarn dev
```

**_Ta-da!_** ðŸŽ‰
