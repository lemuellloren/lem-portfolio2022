### Install the dependencies

```bash
# NPM
npm i

# Yarn
yarn
```

### Edit content

Now, before you run it locally, you should edit the content first!

To do so, open the `data/config.js` file and edit the values to what makes you, you!

### Run locally!

To see it in action in your browser, run the `dev` script:

```bash
# NPM
npm run dev

# Yarn
yarn dev
```
